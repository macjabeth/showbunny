## About The Project

There are many great streaming sites on the web; however, most of them lacked features I wished were included. I wanted to create a site so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

## Built With

This project was built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- [H5BP](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
