# Showbunny: Watch your favourite movies and TV shows

This branch is a personal project in the attempt to redesign the website from scratch using better organisation and a mobile-first layout.

**Notice** - The current design uses experimental features only available on Google Chrome. Other browsers will display incorrectly (hence the needs for this redesign). Accessibility is important.

## Description

The client for this challenge is _Mr. Bunny_. He needs your help to build the Showbunny website using best practices for HTML and CSS - that includes both desktop and mobile designs.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, you may use the existing website as a reference for how it should be structured:

Any changes or improvements over the existing layout are welcome and encouraged.

## Project Set Up

Because we are using a preprocessor, there are two parts to setting up this project.  Be sure to run through the git set up first and then set up the preprocessor.

### Git Set up

Follow these steps to set up this project:

- Create a forked copy of this project.
- Clone your OWN version of the repository (not mine by mistake!).
- Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

Follow these steps for completing your tasks.

- Submit a pull-request to merge your `<firstName-lastName>` branch into this branch (macjabeth/showbunny > mobile-redesign).
- Add me as a reviewer on the pull-request
- I will review the changes as complete by merging the branch into master.

### Preprocessor Set up

- Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running `lessc -v` in your terminal.
- Open your terminal and navigate to your cloned folder by using the `cd` command
- Once in your project's root folder, run the following command: `less-watch-compiler less css index.less`
- Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the `background-color` on the `html` selector to `red` in your `index.less` file.
- Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you're ready to start on the next task
