## About The Project

![Screen Shot](img/screenshot.png)

There are many great streaming sites on the web; however, most of them lacked features I wished were included. I wanted to create a site so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

## Built With

This project was built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

* [H5BP](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, please follow the below steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your machine:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

First you will want to clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/macjabeth/showbunny.git
```

Then install NPM packages.

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

The default npm scripts are as follows.
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite", // start dev server
    "build": "vite build", // build for production
    "serve": "vite preview" // locally preview production build
  }
}
```
To start the dev server, type `npm run dev` into the terminal.
